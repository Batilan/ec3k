am433 ISM band receiver
=======================

Toolkit for developing, debugging and reverse engineering devices that use
ISM band transmissions using OOK modulation. Common devices that can be
analyzed this way are cheap battery powered weather monitors and other
wireless sensors, various remote controls and key-less access systems

hardware/

	This is a simple and cheap design for a USB connected radio
	receiver that can receive digital, binary amplitude modulated
	transmissions (also known as OOK - on/off keying, 100% amplitude
	modulation, ASM).
	
	It uses a hybrid super-regen receiver module, which is available
	off-the-shelf for 433 and 868 MHz ISM bands and an audio codec from
	an USB dongle.
	
am433/

	This folder contains a software demodulator that is capable of
	detecting and demodulating a number of baseband encodings.

Available elsewhere:

libpcap/

	Patched libpcap using the capture process from am433/ to capture
	packets off the air.

tcpdump/

	Patched tcpdump for use with the patched libpcap above that
	includes some packet printers for common devices that can be seen
	transmitting on these bands.



How to compile
==============

Run bootstrap.sh from the top directory of the distribution. It will
compile the demodulator and download and build the patched versions of
libpcap and tcpdump. 

You can then run the tcpdump directly from the build directory (you can
manually do "make install", but it is not necessary)

$ cd tcpdump
$ ./tcpdump -D

Will list all available audio interfaces. Choose the one that represents
the receiver dongle (usually named "C-Media ...")

You can then start the packet capture with, say:

$ ./tcpdump -X -i am433_x_x
